## Description
As part of the PwC Power BI in Data Analytics Virtual Case Experience, I analyzed a customer churn dataset for a telecom client of PwC Switzerland. Through exploratory data analysis, I uncovered insights into the customer churn patterns, which I then visualized in a Power BI dashboard report. The report provided a clear and interactive way to communicate my findings, helping the client to better understand their customer behavior and make informed decisions to improve customer retention.

## Project Details

**What is Churn?** \
*Churn* refers to the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company or service, typically expressed as a percentage of the customer base. 

**What is a Churn Rate?** \
*Churn Rate*, sometimes known as attrition rate, is the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company over a given period of time. Churn may also apply to the number of subscribers who cancel or don’t renew a subscription. The higher your churn rate, the more customers stop buying from your business. The lower your churn rate, the more customers you retain. Typically, the lower your churn rate, the better.

**Churn Rate** = (Churned Customers / Total Number of Customers) x 100%

**What is Customer Churn?** \
*Customer Churn* refers to the natural business cycle of losing and acquiring customers. 
Every company — no matter the quality of its products or customer service experiences churn. In the context of businesses, customer churn can occur due to factors such as dissatisfaction with the product or service, competitive offerings, or changes in circumstances or preferences of the customer.
Generally speaking, the less churn a company has, the more customers they keep.
